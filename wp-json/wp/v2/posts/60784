In this sprint, we\u2019ve also improved some UI\/UX processes like registration for newcomers that will ensure better functionality and a smoother user journey from start to end. We also gave our security measures an upgrade to further make our vision of becoming the first so-called CeDeFi or Centralised and Decentralised Finance banking services platform out there. A hybrid mix between the modern and the traditional. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s get into more detail about the recent updates.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:48px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong><strong>Currency X\u2122 got its own wallet section<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/babbdev.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2519\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>The fundraising product is no longer supported on the Babb app. But, in its wake comes the new face of Babb and the addition of the Currency X\u2122 wallet that now holds GBPx and USDx. To soon expand and include EURx and other currencies from across the globe.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, when our users log back in right after the new update, they will encounter two separate wallet sections, offering the ability to switch between their Currency X\u2122 and Crypto wallet. This provides a smoother experience on the app and an upgraded, cleaner format that allows users to easily differentiate between their holdings as stablecoin and other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This specific UI (User Interface) update is considered crucial as it lays the groundwork for the introduction of Babb\u2019s UK banking product in 2023.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:48px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong><strong>USDx joins the X family<\/strong><\/strong>.<\/h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/babbdev.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2514\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Everyone, and especially Babbians interested in USD transactions, we welcome USDx, the latest addition to Babb\u2019s Currency X\u2122 bundle of stablecoins!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>USDx will have the same features as GBPx currently, with top up and cash out actions working for all of Babb\u2019s operational countries (check the list <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/getbabb.com\/supported-countries\/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers on the app will not only benefit from lower external fees on USD top up and cash out, but also transact USDx with low internal fees. The following pairs are now available for conversion as well as sending and receiving:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>USDx\/BAX \u2013 BAX\/USDx \u2013 USDx\/RIALxS \u2013 RIALxS\/USDx&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just to jog your memory, USDx is part of the Currency X\u2122 bundle of stablecoins that offers a trusted way to send remittances for very low fees. Pegged to the value of their respective currencies, which in this case is USD, Currency X\u2122 stablecoins allow you to send, receive, top up and withdraw to FIAT from inside the app with ease and convenience, and convert to BTC, ETH, and BAX.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:48px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong><strong>GBPx\/BAX; what a pair!<\/strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may recall, GBPx was released earlier this year with GBPx\/RIALxS, and was tested and utilised as part of the remittance flow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this update, we\u2019ve enabled a new conversion pair for GBPx that is available in both directions, GBPx\/BAX and BAX\/GBPx. This important addition enables conversions between GBPx and BAX, allowing further conversions to supported crypocurrencies and stablecoins until direct conversions are enabled in future updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new pair also addresses recent feedback about alternative GBPx functionality, when users do not intend to process GBPx for remittance purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/babbdev.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2515\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:48px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong><strong>Bank top up and card top up are now both available for GBPx, USDx and BAX<\/strong><\/strong>.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To increase functionality and widen our tokens\u2019 capability on the app, bank top up is now enabled for GBPx, USDx, as well as BAX for all users in all supported countries.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This update will provide the option of lower external fees for Babbians to import or export funds in-and-out of the Babb app while prepping the scene and testing the technology for the introduction of the Babb debit card and UK banking product in 2023.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A further UI\/UX improvement on the top up and cash out processes is already scheduled for release in Sprint 4 later this year.
