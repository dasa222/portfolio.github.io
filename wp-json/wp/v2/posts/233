These wallets are also decentralised so the owners of BAX stored in Metamask wallets will need to visit the portal and submit their Metamask addresses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Q: And what if I hold BAX in a trust wallet?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: If by \u201ctrust wallet\u201d it is referenced to the third-party provider, &nbsp;https:\/\/trustwallet.com\/ethereum-wallet\/ \u2013 they appear to be an external wallet provider similar to Metamask. The best way would be the customer to contact \u201ctrust wallet\u201d and ask them if their wallet can support ERC20 transactions. If this is the case, the customer will need to visit the portal and submit their wallet address.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Q: And what would happen if I hold BAX in a cold wallet?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: Cold wallet may have various meanings in different contexts. If this is a hardware wallet such as Trezor, they should work the same way as standard ERC20 wallets, and will require users\u2019 visit the priority portal to submit their wallet addresses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: However, some cold wallets may also be complicated smart contracts. Customers are responsible for making sure that the wallet address provided for the priority transfer can receive the new ERC20 BAX token.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Q: And what about BAX holdings on Ledger Wallet?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: Reference to https:\/\/www.ledger.com\/erc20-wallet; similar to above, this seems to be a hardware wallet. The customers should contact the provider and make sure the wallet address they provide to Babb supports incoming ERC20 transactions for a new (upgraded) token that they haven\u2019t used before. If the wallet supports this, the customer needs to visit the priority request portal and submit the wallet address holding the BAX.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Q: And BAX on Coinbase wallet?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: Babb is not listed on Coinbase centralised exchange yet. The only reference is https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/how-to-buy\/erc20 \u2013 as above, the customers should contact this provider and make sure the wallet address they submit to Babb priority request portal supports incoming ERC20 transactions for a new (upgraded) token that they haven\u2019t used before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Q: What is the status of BAX trading pairs during the swap?&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: While blockchain transactions need to be paused temporarily during the swap period, both Babb app and&nbsp;<strong>centralised<\/strong>&nbsp;exchanges intend to provide BAX trading pairs throughout the swap. There may be a brief disruption to trading during the swap, we will provide further updates through socials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>!!\ud83d\udea8 You must stop trading on decentralised exchanges (DEXs), before Babb commences the swap. \ud83d\udea8!!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the swap, Babb will no longer regard the OLD token as its utility token, the upgraded BAX will replace the utility on all platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:64px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What can you expect for the coming days?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u23f8&nbsp;<strong>Babb and centralized exchanges will pause BAX deposits and withdrawals on June 6.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019lIn order to facilitate the smart contract swap in Babb\u2019s and centralised exchanges\u2019 blockchain implementations, the deposits and withdrawals will be paused during the swap period which is expected to be between June 6 and June 9.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83d\udd5b\u00a0<strong>Snapshot swap is targeted for the midnight connecting June 6 to June 7 (UTC).\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Babb will save blockchain balances as of 6 June 2022 23:59:59 UTC for airdrop transactions of the upgraded BAX contract.
