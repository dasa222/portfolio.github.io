Cryptocurrencies may not be new, but the past couple of years have been crucial for digital asset variety.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency has been gaining ground for several years, but it is only in recent times it has started to integrate itself into our daily lives. Growing acceptance and wider adoption of cryptocurrencies raises crucial questions about the future of banking. With increasing use cases of cryptocurrencies and stable coins, decentralized banking becomes a viable alternative and a future with official recognition by governments is getting even closer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a leading cryptocurrency platform, BABB has been a driving force in the cryptocurrency industry. BABB aims to become one of the first regulated decentralized Banking Service Platforms in the UK. The platform has earmarked 2023 as the year this vision becomes a reality. With this aim firmly in mind, BABB Group\u2019s CEO Mr. Rushd Averroes, made a significant step forward with his quest on October 5, 2022. On this date, the BABB platform made its first salary transfer in GBPx, and Mr. Averroes became the first person to be paid in CurrencyX through the BABB app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cStanding here, at the foot of the most beautiful building on earth,\u201d Averroes said. \u201cDesigned by architect Shaun Killa, the Arabic calligraphy on the facade hopes to inspire people to build a better tomorrow. And at Babb, we\u2019re innovating for the good of humanity.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This milestone moment is a hugely significant step for the BABB platform. But also, a major step forward for the two billion people worldwide that do not have access to a banking system and will ultimately benefit the local communities where they live. The following 12 months will be an exciting time both for the BABB platform and cryptocurrency in general.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Interested in keeping up with BAX and BABB?
