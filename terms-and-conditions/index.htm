<p><span data-contrast="auto">The trading of cryptocurrencies entails certain risks. This document provides you with information about some of these risks, but cannot predict all of the risks which may arise nor can it describe how such risks relate to your personal circumstances. If you are in any doubt about whether cryptocurrencies are right for you, you may wish to seek guidance from a professional adviser.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for any form of exposure to cryptocurrencies.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></p>

<h6><span data-contrast="auto">Cryptocurrencies are unregulated.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></h6>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Since the trading of cryptocurrencies are not subject to regulation, cryptocurrencies are not governed by any specific UK or European regulatory framework. This means that, when using cryptocurrencies, you will not benefit from the protections available to customers receiving regulated services.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Given the unregulated nature of cryptocurrencies, customers are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></p>

<h6><span data-contrast="auto">Trading in cryptocurrencies carries special risks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></h6>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cryptocurrencies also carry special risks not generally shared with official currencies or goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, cryptocurrency is a unique medium of exchange, in that there is no central bank that can take corrective measures to protect the value of cryptocurrency in a crisis.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Instead, cryptocurrencies are an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of currency. Traders of such currencies put their trust in a digital, decentralised and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></p>

<h6><span data-contrast="auto">The value of cryptocurrencies is highly volatile.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></h6>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The market for cryptocurrencies is still relatively new and uncertain. The price of cryptocurrencies can rapidly increase or decrease at any time and may even fall to zero. The risk of loss in trading or holding an interest in cryptocurrencies can be substantial and can result in the loss of the entire value of your cryptocurrency.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The cryptocurrency market is highly susceptible to market manipulation and other misuse for illegal activities. The market is likely to be adversely affected if law enforcement agencies investigate any allegedly illegal activities on the Cryptocurrency Exchange or any other cryptocurrency platform.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">More generally, cryptocurrencies are susceptible to bubbles or loss of confidence (irrational or otherwise), which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence might collapse in any given cryptocurrency because of unexpected changes imposed by the software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></p>

<h6><span data-contrast="auto">Cryptocurrency Exchanges are vulnerable to cyber attacks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></h6>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cryptocurrency exchanges are entirely digital and, as with any virtual system, are at risk from hackers, malware and operational glitches. Even though Cryptocurrency Exchanges take various steps to preserve the security of their platforms, cryptocurrency which is held in wallets provided by such exchanges remain vulnerable to hacking.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If a thief gains access to one or more cryptocurrencies (i.e. by stealing the private encryption key to the Cryptocurrency Exchange wallets), he/she could transfer the stolen assets to another account. This is particularly problematic since all cryptocurrency transactions are permanent and irreversible.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Accordingly, a hack is likely to lead to substantial depletion of the cryptocurrency held on your behalf. Whilst the Cryptocurrency Exchange may be willing to compensate users for any such loss, they are not obliged to do so. A serious hack could also have the effect of putting a Cryptocurrency Exchange into insolvency.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></p>

<h6><span data-contrast="auto">The legal status of cryptocurrency is uncertain and constantly evolving.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></h6>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Given that the market for cryptocurrencies is relatively new, the legal nature of cryptocurrency is – in most jurisdictions – yet to be determined by statute, regulation or case law. In the absence of such authority, it is not clear how a regulator or court may treat interests or rights arising trading in cryptocurrencies. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It is possible that a national or supranational regulator may take unilateral action to legislate the cryptocurrency market in a manner which prevents or encumbers the proper operation of the market in your jurisdiction. This may impact whether we can offer cryptocurrencies to you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:390}"> </span></p>

<h6><strong><u>5.6 </u></strong></h6>
<p>The Buyer hereby has sufficient knowledge and experience in business and financial matters to be able to evaluate the risks and merits of its purchase of BAX Token(s) and other cryptographic tokens and is able to bear the risks thereof. The Buyer is aware of Company’s business affairs and financial condition and has acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision in relation to the purchase of BAX Token(s). The Buyer understands that the said Tokens involve risks, all of which the Buyer fully and completely assumes, including, but not limited to, the risk that (i) the technology associated with the Network may not function as intended; (ii) the Network may fail to attract sufficient interest from users and/or key stakeholders whether now or in future or may lose the interest from users and/or key stakeholders whether now or in future; and (iv) the Company and/or the Network may be subject to investigation and punitive actions from Governmental Authorities.

The Buyer understands and expressly accepts that the Buyer has not relied on any representations or warranties made by the Company outside of this document/this Agreement, including, but not limited to, conversations of any kind, whether through oral or electronic communication, or any white paper or publication. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, THE BUYER ASSUMES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL RISK AND LIABILITY FOR THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY THE USE OF ANY TOKENS AND REGARDLESS OF ANY ORAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY, BY WAY OF TECHNICAL ADVICE OR OTHERWISE, RELATED TO THE USE OF THE TOKENS.</p>
<h6><strong><u>5.7</u></strong></h6>
<p>The Buyer understands that Buyer bears sole responsibility for any taxes as a result of the matters and transactions arising from this document/this Agreement, and any future acquisition, ownership, use, sale or other disposition of BAX Tokens or other cryptographic tokens held by the Buyer. To the extent permitted by law, the Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Company or any of its affiliates, employees or agents (including developers, auditors, contractors or founders) harmless for any claim, liability, assessment or penalty with respect to any taxes (other than any net income taxes of the Company that result from the issuance or sale of the BAX Tokens or other cryptographic tokens to the Buyer as required by law) associated with or arising from the Buyer’s purchase of the BAX Tokens or other cryptographic tokens hereunder, or the use or ownership of the BAX Tokens or other cryptographic tokens.</p>
<h6><strong><u>5.8</u></strong></h6>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>ARTICLE SIX: PROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF RIGHTS AND VALUATION OF PURCHASE AMOUNT</u></strong></h4>
<h6><strong><u>6.1 </u></strong></h6>
<p>The Buyer shall make the required payment to the Company in consideration for the Buyer’s purchase of the BAX Token(s) or other cryptographic token(s) offered by the Company through the procedures and in accordance with the instructions set forth on the Company Website or as otherwise clearly communicated to the Buyer.</p>
<h6><strong><u>6.2 </u></strong></h6>
<p>For purposes of this document/this Agreement, the value of the Purchase Amount shall be deemed in U.S. dollars whether the Buyer pays in Ether, valued at the Applicable Exchange Rate for Ether. The term “Applicable Exchange Rate” shall mean the volume-weighted average daily price of Ether across exchanges in the one hour preceding when funds received by BABB (the “Effective Time”); provided, however, that in the event that such exchanges experience technical issues in such period that affect the accuracy of the volume-weighted average price, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to determine the volume weighted average price of Ether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>ARTICLE SEVEN: RISKS </u></strong></h4>
<p>BAX TOKENS, LIKE ALL CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS, MAY HAVE NO VALUE. THE BUYER MAY LOSE ALL AMOUNTS PAID. The Buyer has carefully reviewed, acknowledges, understands and assumes the following risks, as well as all other risks associated with cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrency (including those not discussed herein), all of which could render the BAX Tokens worthless or of little value:</p>
<h6><strong><u>7.1 </u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN</strong>: The Ethereum blockchain is prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Individuals may also intentionally spam the Ethereum network in an attempt to gain an advantage in purchasing cryptographic tokens. The Buyer acknowledges and understands that Ethereum block producers may not include the Buyer’s transaction when the Buyer wants or the Buyer’s transaction may not be included at all.</p>
<h6><strong><u>7.2 </u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>ABILITY TO TRANSACT OR RESELL:</strong> The Buyer may be unable to sell or otherwise transact in the BAX Token(s) at any time, or for the price which the Buyer paid. The Buyer acknowledges, understands and agrees that:</p>
<p>(a) BAX Tokens may have no value at any given point in time;</p>
<p>(b) there is no guarantee or representation of liquidity for the BAX Tokens; and</p>
<p>(c) the Parties are not and shall not be responsible for or liable for the market value of BAX Tokens, the transferability and/or liquidity of BAX Tokens and/or the availability of any market for BAX Tokens through third parties or otherwise.</p>
<h6><strong><u>7.3 </u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>TOKEN SECURITY</strong>: The BAX Token(s) or other cryptographic token(s) offered acquired or purchased through or from the Company may be subject to expropriation and or/theft. Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with the Company’s digital or other infrastructure or systems or the BAX Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Ethereum platform rests on open source software and BAX Tokens are based on open source software, there is the risk that Ethereum smart contracts may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the BAX Tokens or result in the loss of the Buyer’s BAX Tokens, the loss of the Buyer’s ability to access or control the Buyer’s BAX Tokens or the loss of ETH or Ether in the Buyer’s account. In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy and holders of BAX Tokens are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.</p>
<h6><strong><u>7.4</u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>ACCESS TO PRIVATE KEYS</strong>: BAX Token(s) or other cryptographic token(s) purchased by the Buyer may be held by the Buyer in the Buyer’s digital wallet or vault, which requires a private key, or a combination of private keys, for access. Accordingly, loss of the requisite private key(s) associated with the Buyer’s digital wallet or vault storing the/any BAX Token(s) will result in loss of such BAX Token(s), access to the Buyer’s BAX Token balance and/or any initial balances in blockchains created by third parties. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet or vault service which the Buyer uses, may be able to misappropriate the Buyer’s BAX Tokens. The Company is not responsible for any such losses.</p>
<h6><strong><u>7.5</u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>NEW TECHNOLOGY</strong>: The BABB Software, the BABB App and the BABB Platform and all such related infrastructure are new technology in a growing and developing industry. As such the technology through which the BABB Software, the BABB App and the BABB Platform operates has a degree of uncertainty and might not function as intended, and any tokens associated with a blockchain adopting the BABB Software may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable. Furthermore, as this technology is changing rapidly, the BAX Tokens and any tokens transferable on the BABB Platform may become outdated and this may have a negative impact on the value and merchantability of the BAX Tokens (in line with other cryptographic tokens in general).</p>
<h6><strong><u>7.6</u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>RELIANCE ON THIRD-PARTIES</strong>: The BABB Software, the BABB App and the BABB Platform relies and will rely, in whole or partly, on third parties to adopt and implement it and to continue to develop, supply, maintain and otherwise support it. There is no assurance or guarantee that those third parties will complete their work, properly carry out their obligations, or otherwise meet anyone’s needs, all of which might have a material adverse effect on the BABB Software and BABB Platform as well as the BAX Token(s) and their value, consumer interest in the said Token(s) and their merchantability.</p>
<h6><strong><u>7.7</u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>FAILURE TO MAP A PUBLIC KEY TO BUYER&#8217;S ACCOUNT</strong>: Any failure of the Buyer to map a public key to the Buyer’s account may result in third parties being unable to recognise the Buyer’s BAX Token balance on the Ethereum blockchain when and if they configure the initial balances of a new blockchain based upon the BABB Software and/or the BABB App of which the Company makes no representation or guarantee.</p>
<h6><strong><u>7.8 </u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>EXCHANGE &amp; COUNTER-PARTY RISKS</strong>: If the Buyer chooses to maintain or hold the BAX Token(s) through a cryptocurrency exchange or other third party, the Buyer’s BAX Tokens may be stolen or lost. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that if the Buyer holds BAX Tokens on a cryptocurrency exchange or with another third party, the Buyer does so at his/her/its own and sole risk</p>
<h6><strong><u>7.9 </u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>CHANGES TO THE BABB SOFTWARE</strong>: The BABB Software and/or the BABB App may undergo significant specification and other changes over time in the interests of, but not limited to, modernisation, security updates, consumer feedback on interface as well as other reasons in the interests of the Company’s viability, competitiveness and providing value for money. The Company may make changes to such features and specifications for any number of reasons, and any party that adopts the BABB Software and/or the BABB App and launches the BABB Platform also may make changes, any of which may mean that the BABB Platform does not meet the Buyer’s expectations (initial or otherwise).</p>
<h6><strong><u>7.10 </u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>RISK OF ALTERNATIVE BLOCKCHAINS AND LACK OF INTEREST:</strong> It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilise the same technology and protocol underlying the network, either directly or indirectly through reverse engineering, and attempt to facilitate materially similar services as the Company. BABB may compete with these alternative networks, which could lead the Company to forego the onward progression, maintenance, perpetuation, continuance and/or development of the BAX Token(s) and BABB Software. Alternatively, the onward future maintenance, perpetuation, continuance and/or development of the BAX Token(s) and BABB Software may be foregone in the event of a lack of interest and participation of third parties (consumers and others alike). There can be no assurance or guarantee that there will be sufficient interest or participation in the BABB Platform. Any decision to forego the onward progression, maintenance, perpetuation, continuance and/or development of the BAX Token(s) and BABB Software and the BABB Platform will be at the sole discretion of the Company.</p>
<h6><strong><u>7.11 </u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>UNCERTAIN AND DEVELOPING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK</strong>: The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear, unsettled or otherwise developing in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies and to what extent or even the impact of any such regulation. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules that will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications. Such changes could negatively impact BAX Token(s) in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that BAX Tokens are regulated financial instruments that require registration. The Company may cease the distribution of BAX Tokens, the development of the BABB Software and/or the BABB Platform or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to such operations and services.</p>
<h6><strong><u>7.12 </u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>RISK OF GOVERNMENT ACTION</strong>: As noted above, the industry in which the Company operates is relatively new against the wider backdrop of other comparable products and industries, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement action(s). There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not examine the operations of the Company and/or pursue enforcement actions against the Company. Such governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting the Company in particular but the industry or field of cryptographic tokens, assets and digital assets/currency in general. All of this may subject the Company to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause the Company to restructure its operations and activities or to cease to offer certain products or services, all of which could harm Company’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the BAX Token(s) and the value and merchantability of the BAX Token(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>ARTICLE EIGHT: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION </u></strong></h4>
<h6><strong><u>8.1 </u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Buyer disclaims any right or cause of action against the BABB Parties of any kind in any jurisdiction that would give rise to any Damages whatsoever, on the part of any BABB Party. Each of the BABB Parties shall not be liable to the Buyer for any type of Damages, even if and notwithstanding the extent a BABB Party has been advised of the possibility of such Damages. The Buyer agrees not to seek any refund, compensation or reimbursement from a BABB Party, regardless of the reason, and regardless of whether the reason is identified in this Agreement.</p>
<h6><strong><u>8.2 </u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>DAMAGES</strong>: In no circumstances will the aggregate joint liability of the BABB Parties, whether in contract, warrant, tort or other theory, doctrinal or jurisprudential concept, for Damages to the Buyer under this Agreement exceed the amount received by Company from the Buyer.</p>
<h6><strong><u>8.3 </u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>FORCE MAJEURE</strong>: The Buyer understands and agrees that Company shall not be liable and disclaims all liability to the Buyer in connection with any force majeure event, including acts of God, labour disputes or other industrial disturbances, electrical, telecommunications, hardware, software or other utility failures, software or smart contract bugs or weaknesses, earthquakes, storms, or other nature-related events, blockages, embargoes, riots, acts or orders of government, acts of terrorism or war, technological change, changes in interest rates or other monetary conditions, and, for the avoidance of doubt, changes to any blockchain-related protocol, process or practice.</p>
<h6><strong><u>8.4 </u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>RELEASE</strong>: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Buyer releases the BABB Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or Damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between the Buyer and the acts or omissions of third parties.</p>
<h6><strong><u>8.5 INDEMNIFICATION</u></strong></h6>
<p>(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Buyer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless and reimburse the BABB Parties from and against any and all actions, proceedings, claims, Damages, demands and actions (including without limitation fees and expenses of legal or advisory counsel), incurred by a BABB Party arising from or relating to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Buyer’s purchase of the BAX Token(s) and/or other cryptographic token(s) offered through or from the Company</li>
</ul>
<p>(ii) The Buyer’s responsibilities or obligations under this Agreement</p>
<ul>
<li>The Buyer’s breach of or violation of this Agreement</li>
</ul>
<p>(iv) Any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the Buyer;</p>
<p>(v) The Buyer’s violation of any rights of any other person or entity; and/or</p>
<p>(vi) any act or omission of the Buyer that is negligent, unlawful or constitutes willful misconduct</p>
<p>(b) The Company reserves the right to exercise sole control over the defence, at the Buyer’s expense, of any claim subject to indemnification under this Article 8.5 of this Agreement (above). This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between the Buyer and the Company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>ARTICLE NINE: DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITATION </u></strong></h4>
<h6><strong><u>9.1</u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong>: The Buyer and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement and in relation to the BABB App and/or the BABB Platform and the purchase, sale, distribution, offering, handling, dealing, storing, transacting, performance of the BAX Token(s) and/or any other cryptographic token(s) through the scope of the Company’s services and/or platform, including with respect to the formation, applicability, breach, termination, validity or enforceability thereof (a “Dispute”). If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute within ninety (90) days of notice of such Dispute being received by all Parties, such Dispute shall be finally settled by Binding Arbitration as defined in Article 9.2 (below).</p>
<h6><strong><u>9.2 </u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>BINDING ARBITRATION</strong>: Any Dispute not resolved within 90 days as set forth in Article 9.1 (above) shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) rules in effect at the time of the arbitration, except as they may be modified herein or by mutual agreement of the Parties. The number of arbitrators shall be one who shall be selected by Company. The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be London, England. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. The governing law of the Agreement shall be as set forth in Article 10.1 herein. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties (“Binding Arbitration”). The Parties undertake to carry out any award without delay and waive their right to any form of recourse insofar as such waiver can validly be made.

Any provision of this instrument may be amended, waived or modified only upon the written consent of the Company.</p>
<h6><strong><u>10.4 SEVERABILITY</u></strong></h6>

<h6><strong><u>10.5</u></strong></h6>

<h6><strong><u>10.7 </u></strong></h6>
<p><strong>NO WAIVERS</strong>: The failure by the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a present or future waiver of such right or provision nor limit the Company’s right to enforce such right(s) or provision(s) at a later time. All waivers by the Company must be unequivocal and in writing to be effective.</p>
<h6><strong><u>10.8 </u></strong></h6>
